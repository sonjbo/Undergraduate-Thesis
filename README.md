## **Study Overview**
This project examined cultural and socioeconomic influences on schizophrenia prodromal symptoms and stigma across international populations.

A cross-sectional online survey was administered to **822 participants** from **Brazil, India, Italy, and the United States** using Amazon Mechanical Turk. After quality filtering, **200 participants** remained (**121 males**, **79 females**).

Prodromal symptoms were measured using the **Prodromal Questionnaire–Brief (PQ-B)**, capturing both symptom presence and associated distress. Attitudes toward schizophrenia were assessed using the **Stereotypes of Schizophrenia Scale**.

**Primary hypothesis:**  
Lower income economies would show higher rates of prodromal symptoms.

Predictive associations were examined between prodromal symptoms and:
- attitudes toward schizophrenia  
- immigration status  
- substance/cannabis use  
- income  
- gender  
- age

## **Measures**

### **Prodromal Questionnaire – Brief Version (PQ-B)**  
*Loewy et al., 2011*

- 21-item measure of psychosis-like experiences
- **Total score**: sum of all items  
  - “I have not experienced this” = 0  
  - Any experience (“strongly disagree” → “strongly agree”) = 1  
- **Distress score**:  
  - “I have not experienced this” = 0  
  - “Strongly disagree” = 1 → “Strongly agree” = 5  

**Example prompt:**  
> “If you have experienced any of the following in the past month, indicate the extent to which each experience frightened or concerned you… Do not include experiences only under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or unprescribed medication.”
